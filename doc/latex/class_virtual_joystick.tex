\subsection{Detailed Description}
Virtual representation of game buttons/keys. 

Careful, because this may be confusing\-: A \hyperlink{class_virtual_joystick}{Virtual\-Joystick} is a virtual representation of the game buttons. It is useful whenever we want to make an \hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} move, because assigning a \hyperlink{class_joystick}{Joystick} to it (if it doesn't already have one, which is probable since it is created by the constructor) we can code the \hyperlink{class_joystick}{Joystick}'s buttons pressed and, therefore, make the \hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} move. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/\hyperlink{joystick_8h}{joystick.\-h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
